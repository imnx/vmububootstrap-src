.TH VMDEBOOTSTRAP 8
.SH NAME
vmdebootstrap \- install basic Debian system into virtual disk image
.SH SYNOPSIS
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B vmdebootstrap
installs a basic Debian system into a virtual disk image,
for use with virtual machines,
such as KVM, Qemu, or VirtualBox.
It is like
.BR debootstrap (8),
which does the same thing, but puts the system into a directory,
for use with
.BR chroot (8).
(In fact,
.B vmdebootstrap
is a wrapper around
.BR debootstrap ).
.PP
You need to run
.B vmdebootstrap
as root.
.PP
To use the image,
you probably want to create a virtual machine using your preferred
virtualization technology, such as 
.BR kvm (1),
or
.BR qemu (1).
Configure the virtual machine to use the image you've created.
Then start the virtual machine,
and log into it via its console to configure it.
.PP
The image will be using
.BR extlinux (1)
as a boot loader.
It has an empty root password.
The image will not have networking configured.
Set the root password before you configure networking.
.SH OPTIONS
.SH EXAMPLE
To create an image for the stable release of Debian:
.nf
.IP
sudo ./vmdebootstrap --image test.img --size 1g \\
    --log test.log --log-level debug --verbose \\
    --mirror http://mirror.lan/debian/
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.BR debootstrap (8).
